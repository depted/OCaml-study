Okay, let's talk about "Specification!"
A specification is a contract between a client of some unit of code and the implementer of that code.
The most common place we find specifications is as comments in the interface (.mli) files for a module. There, the implementer of the module spells out what the client may and may not assume about the moduleâ€™s behavior.

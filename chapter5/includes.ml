(* articulate difference between include and open*)
module M = struct
  let x = 0
end

module N = struct

  let y = x + 1
end

module O = struct
  open M
  let y = x + 1
end

(*
include is more powerful than open. include means including every definition of module literally. the one that is included is involved with using module.
open is not including a module. it just makes moudule as 0 in scope.    

A metaphor for understanding this difference might be: open M imports definitions from M and makes them available for local consumption, but they arenâ€™t exported to the outside world. Whereas include M imports definitions from M, makes them available for local consumption, and additionally exports them to the outside world.
